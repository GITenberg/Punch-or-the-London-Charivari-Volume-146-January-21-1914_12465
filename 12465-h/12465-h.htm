    <p>MAJOR-GENERAL LEONARD WOOD, chief of the U.S.A. General
    Staff, has reported that the American Army is, practically
    speaking, unarmed, and advises the immediate expenditure of
    &pound;1,200,000 for artillery and ammunition. We fancy,
    however, that the present state of affairs is the result of a
    compromise with the American Peace party, who will not object
    to their country having an army so long as it is unarmed.</p>

    <p>The Rev. N. FITZPATRICK, describing a visit to the Balkan

    ironed in Servia. We are astonished that the lecturer should
    have made no mention of mangling, which we understand is done

    <h2>A FAREWELL TOUR.</h2>

    <p>This is positively Chum's last appearance in print&mdash;for
    his own sake no less than for yours. He is conceited enough as
    it is, but if once he got to know that people are always
    writing about him in the papers his swagger would be
    unbearable. However, I have said good-bye to him now; I have no
    longer any rights in him. Yesterday I saw him off to his new
    home, and when we meet again it will be on a different footing.
    "Is that your dog?" I shall say to his master. "What is he? A
    Cocker? Jolly little fellows, aren't they? I had one myself
    once."</p>

    <p>As Chum refused to do the journey across London by himself,
    I met him at Liverpool Street. He came up in a crate; the world
    must have seemed very small to him on the way. "Hallo, old
    ass," I said to him through the bars, and in the little space
    they gave him he wriggled his body with delight. "Thank Heaven
    there's <i>one</i> of 'em alive," he said.</p>

    <p>"I think this is my dog," I said to the guard, and I told
    him my name.</p>

    <p>He asked for my card.</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid I haven't one with me," I explained. When
    policemen touch me on the shoulder and ask me to go quietly;
    when I drag old gentlemen from underneath motor-'buses, and
    they decide to adopt me on the spot; on all the important
    occasions when one really wants a card, I never have one with
    me.</p>

    <p>"Can't give him up without proof of identity," said the
    guard, and Chum grinned at the idea of being thought so
    valuable.</p>

    <p>I felt in my pockets for letters. There was only one, but it
    offered to lend me &pound;10,000 on my note of hand alone. It
    was addressed to "Dear Sir," and though I pointed out to the
    guard that I was the "Sir," he still kept tight hold of Chum.
    Strange that one man should be prepared to trust me with
    &pound;10,000, and another should be so chary of confiding to
    me a small black spaniel.</p>

    <p>"Tell the gentleman who I am," I said imploringly through
    the bars. "Show him you know me."</p>

    <p>"He's <i>really</i> all right," said Chum, looking at the
    guard with his great honest brown eyes. "He's been with us for
    years."</p>

    <p>And then I had an inspiration. I turned down the inside
    pocket of my coat; and there, stitched into it, was the label
    of my tailor's with my name written on it. I had often wondered
    why tailors did this; obviously they know how stupid guards can
    be.</p>

    <p>"I suppose that's all right," said the guard reluctantly. Of
    course I might have stolen the coat. I see his point.</p>

    <p>"You&mdash;you wouldn't like a nice packing case for
    yourself?" I said timidly. "You see, I thought I'd put Chum on
    the lead. I've got to take him to Paddington, and he must be
    tired of his shell by now. It isn't as if he were <i>really</i>
    an armadillo."</p>

    <p>The guard thought he would like a shilling and a nice
    packing case. Wood, he agreed, was always wood, particularly in
    winter, but there were times when you were not ready for
    it.</p>

    <p>"How are you taking him?" he asked, getting to work with a
    chisel. "Underground?"</p>

    <p>"Underground?" I cried in horror. "Take Chum on the
    Underground? Take&mdash;Have you ever taken a large live
    conger-eel on the end of a string into a crowded carriage?"</p>

    <p>The guard never had.</p>

    <p>"Well, don't. Take him in a taxi instead. Don't waste him on
    other people."</p>

    <p>The crate yawned slowly, and Chum emerged all over straw. We
    had an anxious moment, but the two of us got him down and put
    the lead on him. Then Chum and I went off for a taxi.</p>

    <p>"Hooray," said Chum, wriggling all over, "isn't this
    splendid? I say, which way are you going? I'm going this
    way?... No, I mean the other way."</p>

    <p>Somebody had left some of his milk-cans on the platform.
    Three times we went round one in opposite directions and
    unwound ourselves the wrong way. Then I hauled him in, took him
    struggling in my arms and got into a cab.</p>

    <p>The journey to Paddington was full of interest. For a whole
    minute Chum stood quietly on the seat, rested his fore-paws on
    the open window and drank in London. Then he jumped down and
    went mad. He tried to hang me with the lead, and then in
    remorse tried to hang himself. He made a dash for the little
    window at the back; missed it and dived out of the window at
    the side; was hauled back and kissed me ecstatically, in the
    eye with his sharpest tooth ... "And I thought the world was at
    an end," he said, "and there were no more people. Oh, I am an
    ass. I say, did you notice I'd had my hair cut? How do you like
    my new trousers? I must show you them." He jumped on to my lap.
    "No, I think you'll see them better on the ground," he said,
    and jumped down again. "Or no, perhaps you <i>would</i> get a
    better view if&mdash;" he jumped up hastily, "and yet I don't
    know&mdash;" he dived down, "though of course, if you&mdash;Oh
    lor! this <i>is</i> a day," and he put both paws lovingly on my
    collar.</p>

    <p>Suddenly he was quiet again. The stillness, the absence of
    storm in the taxi was so unnatural that I began to miss it.
    "Buck up, old fool," I said, but he sat motionless by my side,
    plunged in thought. I tried to cheer him up. I pointed out
    King's Cross to him; he wouldn't even bark at it. I called his
    attention to the poster outside the Euston Theatre of The Two
    Biffs; for all the regard he showed he might never even have
    heard of them. The monumental masonry by Portland Road failed
    to uplift him.</p>

    <p>At Baker Street he woke up and grinned cheerily. "It's all
    right," he said, "I was trying to remember what happened to me
    this morning&mdash;something rather-miserable, I thought, but I
    can't get hold of it. However it's all right now. How are
    <i>you</i>?" And he went mad again.</p>

    <p>At Paddington I bought a label at the bookstall and wrote it
    for him. He went round and round my leg looking for me. "Funny
    thing," he said as he began to unwind, "he was here a moment
    ago. I'll just go round once more. I rather think ...
    <i>Ow!</i> Oh, there you are!" I stepped off him, unravelled
    the lead and dragged him to the Parcels Office.</p>

    <p>"I want to send this by the two o'clock train," I said to
    the man the other side of the counter.</p>

    <p>"Send what?" he said.</p>

    <p>I looked down. Chum was making himself very small and black
    in the shadow of the counter. He was completely hidden from the
    sight of anybody the other side of it.</p>

    <p>"Come out," I said, "and show yourself."</p>

    <p>"Not much," he said. "A parcel! I'm not going to be a jolly
    old parcel for anybody."</p>

    <p>"It's only a way of speaking," I pleaded. "Actually you are
    travelling as a small black gentleman. You will go with the
    guard&mdash;a delightful man."</p>

    <p>Chum came out reluctantly. The clerk leant over the counter
    and managed to see him.</p>

    <p>"According to our regulations," he said, and I always
    dislike people who begin like that, "he has to be on a chain. A
    leather lead won't do."</p>

    <p>Chum smiled all over himself. I don't know which pleased him
    more&mdash;the suggestion that he was a very large and fierce
    dog, or the impossibility now of his travelling with the guard,
    delightful man though he might be. He gave himself a shake and
    started for the door.</p>

    <p>"Tut, tut, it's a great disappointment to me," he said,
    trying to look disappointed, but his back <i>would</i> wriggle.

    <p>Poor old Chum; I <i>had</i> known. From a large coat pocket
    I produced a chain.</p>

    <p>"<i>Dash</i> it," said Chum, looking up at me pathetically,
    "you might almost <i>want</i> to get rid of me."</p>

    <p>He was chained, and the label tied on to him. Forgive me
    that label, Chum; I think that was the worst offence of all.
    And why should I label one who was speaking so eloquently for
    himself; who said from the tip of his little black nose to the
    end of his stumpy black tail, "I'm a silly old ass, but there's
    nothing wrong in me, and they're sending me away!" But
    according to the regulations&mdash;one must obey the
    regulations, Chum.</p>

    <p>I gave him to the guard&mdash;a delightful man. The guard
    and I chained him to a brake or something. Then the guard went
    away, and Chum and I had a little talk ...</p>

    was present.</p>

    <p>Sir WILLIAM ROBERTSON NICOLL, writing in <i>The British
    Weekly</i>, asserts that when Mr. MASSINGHAM read "C.K.S.'s"
    recent reference to <i>The Nation</i> in <i>The Sphere</i> he
    kicked the waste-paper basket round the room and tore the hair
    out of his head in handfuls.</p>

    <p>Mr. CECIL CHESTERTON, addressing a meeting of non-party
    fishmongers at Billingsgate last week, stated that he had heard
    that when Mr. GODFREY ISAACS informed the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
    that Mr. HANDEL BOOTH had retired from the Dublin Police
    Inquiry Lord READING OF EARLEY burst into tears and hid his
    face in his wig.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and adds, "Where does English or American journalistic
    enterprise stand beside this?"</p>

    <p>We understand that our more enterprising contemporaries have
    no intention of allowing this question to remain unanswered,
    and the wildest rumours are afloat as to the nature of the
    gifts which will be offered next year to annual subscribers by
    various British journals.</p>

    <p>With a view to test the accuracy of these rumours our
    Special Representative called yesterday upon the Editors of
    several leading publications, and, although much secrecy is
    still maintained, he has succeeded in collecting some valuable
    information. For instance, the report that <i>The Nineteenth
    Century and After</i> would include among its gifts the
    dramatic works of the MELVILLE BROS., <i>HOW to Dance the
    Tango</i>, and <i>Sweeter than Honey</i>, a novel with a strong
    love interest, lacks confirmation; nor are we in a position to
    assert definitely that <i>The Spectator</i> will present a
    beautiful coloured supplement, entitled "Susie's Pet Pup," and
    a handsome mug bearing the inscription: "A Present from Loo,"
    though we believe that such may be the case.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, <i>The Times'</i> reply to an inquiry as
    to whether they would present to each reader half a ton of
    supplements was that they had done so for some years past; and
    <i>The Daily Mirror</i> did not deny that they were considering
    the proposal to present a framed copy of the portrait of John
    Tiffinch which appeared in their issue of February 29, 1913.
    (Tiffinch, our readers will remember, was brother-in-law to the
    man who discovered the great emerald robbery.)</p>

    <p><i>The British Medical Journal's</i> list will include the
    works of GEORGE BERNARD SHAW and the Life of Mrs. EDDY; but the
    report that <i>The Tailor and Cutter</i> would present <i>Wild
    Tribes of Central Africa</i> is emphatically denied.</p>

    <p>Finally, <i>The Boxing World</i> had not thought of offering
    any free-gifts, but on learning that BOSWELL had written a Life
    of JOHNSON seemed inclined to reconsider their decision.</p>

    <h2>THE KAKEKIKOKUANS;</h2>

    <h3>OR, THE HEATHEN IN HIS BLINDNESS.</h3>

    <p>THE country of Kakekikoku, as its name suggests, lies in the
    vicinity of Timbuctoo, the well-known African resort; and at
    the present time, when so much interest is centred upon that
    little-known land, it may be profitable to our readers, as well
    as to the writer, to give some information about it.</p>

    <p>A famous Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, who has
    travelled widely, not only in this country but in Belgium and
    the Channel Islands, has stated that Kakekikoku is richly
    endowed with the bewilderments, perils and mysteries of
    primitive and unexplored African territory. A warlike and
    exclusive folk, the Kakekikokuans extend a red-hot welcome to
    the foreigner who ventures within their borders. They are
    possessed of a fine physique and an intelligence of a subtler
    kind than many savage races can pretend to; yet while having
    all the qualities that should go to the building up of a strong
    nation, certain conditions of their life bar the way to such an
    achievement. In a word, the Kakekikokuans are in the clutches
    of the medicine-man. Each of these despots has his own little
    following, and wields a distinctive influence, it being a point
    of honour with him that his teaching should differ in some way
    (usually in but a trivial detail) from the teaching of any
    other of his kind. The solemnity of their discussions and the
    heat of their dissensions about the minuti&aelig; of their
    creeds would be laughable were it not so pathetic..</p>

    <p>And not only do the medicine-men dispute among themselves,
    but their followers engage even more vehemently in bitter
    strife. For instance, there is a national belief that the
    juby-juby nut, which grows in the forests in profusion,
    possesses some supernatural virtue that will make a man who
    chews it impervious to the weapons of his enemies. That this
    virtue exists is generally accepted; but when it comes to a
    discussion of how, when and where to chew the nut, much
    wrangling goes on; and such men as survive in battle claim that
    their particular method is proved to be the correct one, while
    such as succumb are cited in proof of the error of their
    process of absorbing the juices of the juby-juby nut. The
    survivors include, of course, representatives of various
    schools of thought, and a battle against a common enemy rarely
    goes by without being immediately followed by a conflict among
    the surviving Kakekikokuans in order to put to final proof
    their respective theories about their remarkable fruit. Thus a
    promising people is committing race-suicide; for this sort of
    thing goes on not only in connection with this particular
    problem, but over such questions as the number of beads to wear
    round one's neck when visiting the medicine-man, whether the
    national custom of saluting the rising sun need be observed on
    cloudy mornings, and whether the medicine-man is entitled to
    the pick of the yams on any day but Sunday. People of different
    opinions on these points decline to eat together or to enter
    into social intercourse with one another; and their children
    are forbidden to mingle in play.</p>

    <p>The good news has just come to hand, however, that a band of
    Church of England missionaries, despatched by the Bishop of
    ZANZIBAR, has now entered the country; and it is delightful to
    contemplate the beneficent result that may be expected from
    their broadminded attitude and their sane teaching on the
    subject of the brotherhood of man.</p>

    <h2>LACONICS.</h2>

    <p>"As a matter of fact," said the doctor, "you ought not to
    speak at all. But that's asking too much. So let it go at
    this&mdash;not a word more than is necessary. Good-bye.",</p>

    <p>He left the room and I lay back pondering on his
    instructions. How many words were really necessary?</p>

    <p>The nurse soon after entered.</p>

    <p>"So the doctor's gone," she said.</p>

    <p>Obviously it wasn't necessary to say Yes, since the room was
    empty save for me and her; so I made no reply.</p>

    <p>She went to the window and looked out. The sky was blue and
    the sunshine was brilliant.</p>

    <p>"It's a fine day," she said.</p>

    <p>No, I thought, you don't catch me there; and said nothing.
    But I reflected that yesterday I might myself have made the
    same inane remark as she.</p>

    <p>"Would you like the paper?" she asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said, and then almost regretted it, for having
    waited nearly fifty years for yesterday's news surely I could
    wait longer. Still, the paper would help to pass the time.</p>

    <p>While she was fetching it I remembered a dream of last night
    which I had intended to tell her this morning.</p>

    <p>But why do so? A dream is of no account even to the dreamer.
    Still, the recital might have made her laugh. But why should
    laughter be bothered about?</p>

    <p>The nurse brought the paper and I signified Thank you.</p>

    <p>"I'll leave you for a while now," she said; "The fire's all
    right. Your drink's by the bed. You'll ring if you want
    anything."</p>

    <p>All these things I knew. My drink is always beside the bed;
    the bell is the natural communication between me and the house.
    What a foolish chatterbox the woman was! I nodded and she went
    out.</p>

    <p>On her return an hour or so later she asked, "Is there
    anything in the paper?"</p>

    <p>Before answering I examined this question. What did it mean?
    It did not mean, Are the pages this morning absolutely blank,
    for a change? It meant, Is there a good murder? Is any very
    important person dead? In reply I handed the paper to her.</p>

    <p>Instead of reading it she began a long account of her
    morning's walk. She told me where she had been; whom she had
    seen; whom she had thought she had seen and then found that it
    was some one else; what somebody had said. Not a syllable
    mattered, I now realised; but yesterday I should have joined in
    the talk, asked questions, encouraged her in her
    foolishness.</p>

    <p>Just before lunch my brother and a guest came into the room
    and began to talk about golf. My brother said that he had been
    round in 98. This was his best since September, when he went
    round in 97. He described his difficulties at the tenth
    hole.</p>

    <p>It all seemed very idiotic to me, for the game was over and
    done with. Why rake it up?</p>

    <p>The guest said that he had lost two balls, one of which was
    expensive. His driving had been good, but in the short game he
    had been weak. He could never quite make up his mind whether he
    putted best with a gun-metal putter or a wooden one.</p>

    <p>My brother asked me if I remembered that long drive of his
    two years ago?</p>

    <p>I nodded.</p>

    <p>The nurse came in and told them to go. She then asked me if
    I was hungry.</p>

    <p>"Very," I said.</p>

    <p>She brought me some beef-tea and calf's-foot-jelly,
    remarking that they were easily taken and "would not hurt my
    throat."</p>

    <p>That was why they were chosen, of course.</p>

    <p>In the afternoon I had a visit from my Aunt Lavinia, who sat
    down with the remark that she would tell me all the news.</p>

    <p>"You remember Esther?" she began.</p>

    <p>Esther is my cousin and we were brought up together. How
    could I have forgotten her?</p>

    <p>What she told me about Esther was of no consequence. Then
    she told me how she had nearly lost her luggage at
    Brighton&mdash;she quite thought she had lost it, in
    fact&mdash;but, as it happened, it turned up. "And if I had
    lost it," she said, "it would have been dreadful, for I had a
    number of dear Stella's beautiful sketches in one of my trunks.
    Quite irreplaceable. However, it is all right."</p>

    <p>Then why tell me?</p>

    <p>And so she rattled on.</p>

    <p>"You don't say anything," she said at last.</p>

    <p>It was true. I had said nothing. I told her what the doctor
    instructed.</p>

    <p>"Quite right," she remarked. "I wish other people even in
    good health could have the same prescription."</p>

    <p>Just before dinner my brother came in again. "You've had
    Aunt Lavinia here," he said.</p>

    <p>I had.</p>

    <p>"Getting quite grey, I thought," he said.</p>

    <p>I had noticed it too.</p>

    <p>He was smoking, and while he was with me he emptied his pipe
    and filled it again. He thought he had knocked the burning ash
    in the grate, but it had fallen in the turn-up of his right
    trouser-leg.</p>

    <p>Should I tell him? I wondered. He would, of course, find it
    out from the smell, but meanwhile the cloth would be burned
    through.</p>

    <p>"Your trouser's burning," I said.</p>

    <p>That was the only remark I volunteered all that day; and
    really, except now and then on business, I don't see why one
    should ever talk more.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CURLING.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>The Game and how to Play it, by a Winter
    Sport.</i>)</h4>

    <p>Take a piece of ice (you'll want Switzerland for this). Draw
    two circles, one at each end. Draw a line a short distance from
    each circle. The drawing can be done with a pin, pocket-knife,
    diamond, axe, friend's razor or other edged or pointed
    instrument. I give no dimensions because they are dull things
    and I hate guessing. Talk of the circles at each end as
    "houses" and the lines as "hogs," and you are well on the road
    to become a curler.</p>

    <p>Take two narrow pieces of tin with prickly eruptions on one
    side. Place one each end of the ice-patch, prickly side down,
    and stamp on the smooth side. Why these pieces of tin are
    called "crampits" I can't tell you, unless it's just part of
    the fun.</p>

    <p>You now have a prepared patch that can be used for
    hop-scotch, shove-halfpenny, Rugby football or curling. If you
    have named the things as directed you really ought to use it
    for curling.</p>

    <p>We now come to the question of players. This is one of the
    most important parts of the game. Four a side is the almost
    ideal number, but a few more or less do not make any very great
    difference. But be sure to get some Scotchmen. They take the
    game seriously and do much to make the whole affair bright and
    mirthful. A slight sprinkling of Irishmen often serves to bring
    out more prominently the flavour of the Scottish humour.</p>

    <p>Don't play for money unless you have the majority of
    Scotchmen on your side.</p>

    <p>The game is played with "stones," or, to use their Scotch
    pseudonym, "stanes." To every man two stanes. You can either
    get your "stanes" in England and travel out with them, or hire
    them in the locality. They make the most pleasant travelling
    companions and at times are the cause of many amusing incidents
    which beguile the tedium of the journey. Also they often
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> lead to your picking up
       chance acquaintances. I have known one stone placed in a
       dimly lighted corridor of a train productive of much
       merriment and harmless banter. Being of considerable weight
       they do not readily respond to a playful kick, but having no
       sharp corners they are seldom responsible for serious injury
       to the kicker.</p>

    <p>Every stone, when new, has a handle. Be careful to preserve
    the handle intact on the upper part of the stone. If this
    adjunct be lost or mislaid the stone is less amenable to
    transit and almost useless for its original purpose.</p>

    <p>You will also require a long-handled carpet-broom, which you
    will on arrival re-name a "cow." Most dressing-bags constructed
    for foreign travel are now fitted with these useful and
    picturesque articles. The "cow" is used for two purposes. If
    you are lucky enough to be appointed scorer for your side you
    mark the score on the handle in such a way as to be
    indecipherable by everyone but yourself. This prevents disputes
    with regard to the accuracy of your arithmetic. You also use it
    to sweep the ice in front of a friendly stone which appears
    likely to give up prematurely from exhaustion. Sweeping is
    carried out under the direction of your captain, and the
    process is known in the vernacular as "sooping 'er oop." You
    are not allowed to retard the progress of a stone, friendly or
    otherwise, by intentionally sweeping obstructions into its
    path. To discard a portion of your "cow" in front of a rapidly
    advancing stone is actionable.</p>

    <p>Over-enthusiasm in "sooping 'er 'oop" should be avoided. Ice
    is proverbially slippery, and if you fall on to a friendly
    stone from excess of energy or from debility, your side is
    "huffed" that stone. This is a serious matter, and even if you
    are able to continue the game you are looked on with disfavour
    by your friends.</p>

    <p>The object of the game is to get your stone as near as
    possible to the centre of the circle at the other end of the
    rink. With this object you stand on the piece of tin or
    "crampit" before referred to, grasp the stone firmly by the
    handle and hurl it along the ice. It is almost essential to let
    go the stone at the right moment, otherwise it will hurl you.
    The game is almost identical with the commoner game of "bowls,"
    except for the language, which is worse. The term "wood" is
    inappropriate and must be avoided, as the use of it may lay you
    under a charge of ignorance or flippancy, which you will find
    almost impossible to live down.</p>

    <p>I will conclude with a few hints to novices. Preserve a cool
    head and steady eye. Whilst you are playing your shot your
    captain will be dancing about in the circle at the other end of
    the ice. You will find it best to disregard his maniacal
    shoutings and gesticulations. You will probably not understand
    half of them and will not agree with the other half. If he
    should break a blood-vessel do not take any notice unless some
    part of his fallen body is likely to obstruct your stone. In
    this case you are entitled to have him moved.</p>

    <p>If, after you have played, cries of "hog" or "wobbler"
    arise, remember that you are engaged in a sport and not in
    politics and that there is nothing really offensive in the
    terms. Finally, never scoff at the language used, and above all
    remember that what is one man's game may be another's
    religion.</p>

    <h2>THE POST OFFICE AGAIN.</h2>

    <p>DEAR UNCLE,&mdash;Its your birthday to-day. I sent you some
    nice pairs of hankerchifs because its your birthday. They for
    your nose. Its funny our birthdays being so close. And now no
    more from your loving neice</p>

    <p>NANCY.</p>

    <p>MY DEAR NANCY,&mdash;Thank you very much indeed for the nice
    pocket-handkerchiefs. I am very pleased with them. Nobody has
    ever troubled to give me handkerchiefs before with pretty
    flowers worked in the corners. I have been wearing them to-day,
    or rather one of them. They are so nice that I really meant to
    have kept them specially for parties and things like that, but,
    as I was obliged to leave home in a great hurry this morning,
    and someone had hidden my everyday handkerchiefs, I took one of
    yours.</p>

    <p>Such a funny thing has happened. I sent you for your
    birthday a pretty card with birds on it, and somehow or other
    it got taken in quite a different direction, and was returned
    to me this morning by&mdash;whom do you think? Auntie Maud, all
    the way away in Ireland. But we mustn't blame the
    Postmaster-General without being absolutely sure of ourselves.
    It is very difficult in mysterious cases like this to be
    absolutely sure. Didn't you get my parcel? I sent it off at the
    same time as I sent the card, and I haven't had the parcel
    back. I wonder where it is. It looks as though things were
    going on that you and I know nothing about. I shall be very
    angry with him if he has forgotten to give you your parcel.</p>

    <p>Hoping you are quite well, thank you, Your loving</p>

    <p>UNCLE HENRY.</p>

    <p>DEAR UNCLE,&mdash;Thank you for your pretty card for my
    birthday. I didn't got your parsel. Its very naughty of him
    when its my birthday. I hop youll be very very angry with him
    because its my birthday and I didnt get your parsel. And now no
    more from your loving neice</p>

    <p>NANCY.</p>

    <p><i>The Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;On Tuesday last I despatched by book-post a
    parcel from the South-Western District Office. It is now
    Friday, and the parcel has not been delivered. I should esteem
    it a favour if you would kindly give the Official Handicapper
    for the District in question instructions to allow my parcel to
    start forthwith. Yours faithfully,</p>

    <p>HY. FRESHFIELD.</p>

    <p><i>The Postmaster-General</i>.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;In reply to your enquiry as to the nature of the
    parcel, I beg to inform you that it was oblong in shape and
    done up in brown paper and tied securely with string. To assist
    you still further in the task of identification, I may mention
    that it is addressed to Miss Nancy Freshfield, c/o F.E.L.
    Freshfield, Esq., 47, Ottalie Gardens, Westminster, S.W.</p>

    <p>Trusting that nothing serious has occurred to disqualify my
    parcel, Yours faithfully, HY. FRESHFIELD.</p>

    <p>DEAR UNCLE,&mdash;I thought it was such a long time my
    parsel didnt come I would write to you dear Uncle. I hop you
    were very angry with him. And now no more</p>

    <p>from your loving neice NANCY.</p>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am directed by the Postmaster-General to
    inform you that your parcel has now been traced.</p>

    <p>The name of the addressee was correctly stated by you, but
    you omitted to append such further instructions for the
    guidance of the Post Office as to indicate the destination to
    which you desired it to go. I have the pleasure to add that the
    fuller information has been copied in from your letter, and the
    parcel despatched....</p>

    <p>DEAR NANCY,&mdash;By the same post that brought me your
    letter I heard from our absent-minded friend, the
    Postmaster-General. You will be pained to learn that he is even
    more absent-minded than we thought he was. Although, when I
    handed him your parcel, I distinctly told him it was going to
    Westminster, the moment my back is turned he must needs forget
    all about it.</p>

    <p>I feel really rather sorry for him, and I don't think we
    ought to be angry any more. He can't possibly forget now,
    because I have written the address down for him. Your
    loving</p>

    <h2>A CABINET CRISIS.</h2>

    <p>It had to be faced at last. There is a demand for them
    occasionally, and people won't put up with that excellent one
    taken under the crab-apple tree any longer.</p>

    <p>I was caught just right there. The sun was in an indulgent
    mood and winked at the signs of advancing age. The bald patch
    was out of sight, and the smile would have softened the heart
    of an income-tax assessor. I acquired the negative from the
    amateur performer, and had it vignetted, which made it better
    still, as there was a space between the cashmere sock and the
    spring trousering in the original that I did not want attention
    drawn to. I had a large number of prints made, and dealt them
    out to anybody who asked for a photograph of me. At first they
    aroused considerable enthusiasm, but after five or six years a
    look of doubt began to appear on the faces of the recipients.
    Hadn't I got a later one? This was very nice, but&mdash;I
    pointed out that I hadn't changed at all, or only a very
    little. At my best I was still like that; and didn't they want
    me at my best?</p>

    <p>At last a person described by himself as plain-spoken, and
    by other people as offensively rude, said that I had never
    really been as good-looking as that, with all possible
    allowances made, and any way he wanted a photograph and not a
    memorial card. I took a firm stand, and said that if he wasn't
    satisfied with that one he could go without altogether, and he
    said in the most insulting way that he supposed he should be
    himself again in time if he took a tonic.</p>

    <p>A few more episodes of that sort eventually drove me to it.
    I passed my <i>viva-voce</i> examination at the hands of the
    young lady at the desk, paid my fees, got my testamur, and was
    shown into the torture-chamber, where the head executioner was
    busy adjusting his racks and screws.</p>

    <p>I was rather taken with the rustic seat that was standing on
    a white fur mat in front of a scene representing the Jungfrau,
    but he headed me off it. If I liked the Jungfrau as a
    background I could have it, but not with the seat; that was for
    engaged couples only. He recommended a pair of skis, or a
    bobsleigh; he could put a fine fall of snow into the negative.
    But as I had arrayed myself in a black coat, with one of those
    white waistcoat slips, and a flowing tie with a pearl pin, I
    refused this offer, and we decided we wouldn't have a
    background at all.</p>

    <p>As the man who administered the laughing gas was out at
    lunch, I prepared to go through with it in cold blood, and
    seated myself in the operating chair in the most natural
    attitude I could assume&mdash;something like the one I had
    taken under the crab-tree. I thought I would show them that
    there wasn't so much difference after all. But it did not suit
    the head mechanic at all. He looked at me with his head on one
    side, and then took hold of mine by the chin and the hair and
    gave it a twist. I had never worn it at that angle in my life,
    and I knew it would put my collar all wrong; but I had to do
    what he told me. He arranged my coat so that it should look as
    if it had been made to fit somebody else, and disposed my arms
    in such a way as to give the sleeves the appearance of trouser
    legs with rucks in them. I felt almost more sorry for my tailor
    than for myself, but I shall send him one of the prints when I
    get them; it will be good for him.</p>

    <p>We were now ready to tackle the expression. I had chosen one
    that would have been suitable for a man with a fair No Trump
    hand, but with one suit not fully guarded, as I didn't want to
    overdo it; but, judging from the inquisitor's remarks about the
    graveside, I am quite ready to admit that it might not have
    come out like that. I hastily dealt myself a hundred aces and a
    long suit of clubs, and he said that that was better, but I
    must put off the idea of the funeral altogether. It was not
    until I had assumed the appearance of a reach-me-down Nut with
    a dislocated neck, being made love to by six chorus-girls at
    once, that he condescended to take a look at me through the
    peephole. Then he ran up to me, gave my chin another hitch,
    pulled my neck another foot or two out of my collar, added a
    ruck or two to my sleeves, and said he liked the other side of
    my face better, after all.</p>

    <p>So we went through it all again, and I worked at it with a
    will, for I wanted to see him get under his black cloth and
    finish the business.</p>

    <p>It wasn't as bad as I had thought, but he was not done by
    any means when he had fired his first shot. He rammed more
    cartridges into the breach, and twisted me into three fresh
    contortions. He said he was sure that some of the efforts would
    turn out magnificently.</p>

    <p>I don't feel quite the same confidence myself. I am
    anxiously awaiting the result, and trying to get rid of the
    crick in my neck and to unbuckle the smile in the meantime. If
    it doesn't turn out satisfactorily, I shall get a few
    lines&mdash;not too deep&mdash;put into the negative of the one
    taken under the crab-tree, and a little hair painted
    out&mdash;but not too much.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the repast his lordship casually drew

    for their candid opinion of it, as he was aware that they were
    all good judges, who knew a good thing when they saw it, and he
    would value their opinion.</p>

    <p>And they one and all said it was an excellent champagne, and
    two or three made a note of it in their pocket-books. And such
    was their loyal enthusiasm that the banquet ended in a fine
    glow of something exactly like hilarity.</p>

    <h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

    <h3>"MARY-GIRL."</h3>

    <p>"I'm not going to give up my daily bath!" In these pregnant
    and moving words rang the <i>cri de coeur</i> which was to
    precipitate the tragedy of <i>Mary Sheppard</i>. To you the
    attitude of mind which provoked this cry may seem as natural as
    it was sanitary. But you must understand that it ran directly
    counter to <i>Ezra Sheppard's</i> ideal of the simple
    God-fearing life. Godliness with him came first, and
    cleanliness followed where it could. In his view a tub once a
    week was all that any sane person should need. Apart from this
    hebdomadal use its proper function was to hold dirty dishes and
    soiled clothes for the washing. And indeed this had at one time
    been <i>Mary's</i> own view (though tempered by vague
    aspirations towards a softer existence, as we might have
    guessed from the elegance of her brown shoes) before a year of
    the higher life had shaken her content. Let us go back.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:33%;">
        <a href="images/56.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/56.png"
             alt="" /></a>Mr. MCKINNEL (<i>Ezra Sheppard</i>) to
             Miss MAY BLAYNEY (<i>Mary Sheppard</i>). "You've been
             lying again! You know how I hate it&mdash;I told you
             so in this very theatre when we were playing in
             <i>Between Sunset and Dawn</i>."
    </div>

    <p><i>Ezra Sheppard</i> was by profession a market-gardener,
    and his favourite recreation was preaching in a barn. We have
    the picture of a frugal but happy interior, with a new-born
    infant (<i>off</i>). The trouble began with an offer made to
    his wife of a situation as foster-mother to the baby (also
    <i>off</i>) of a neighbouring Countess. The wages were to be
    high and she was to be delicately entreated; but there were
    hard conditions. She was not to hold communication with her
    husband or child for twelve months. I am sorry to say that
    <i>Mary</i> did not flinch from these conditions quite so much
    as I could have hoped. <i>Ezra</i>, however, rejected them for
    her with manly scorn, until he was reminded that the high wages
    would speed the end of his own ambitions&mdash;namely, to
    replace his barn with a conventicle of brick. So he let his
    wife loose into Eden with the Serpent.</p>

    <p>And now we see <i>Mary</i> seated in the lap of luxury, with
    soft gowns to wear, and peaches to eat and instant slaves at
    her beck. You will, of course, expect her virtue to fall an
    easy prey; but you will be wrong. The Earl's attitude is
    pleasantly parental, and the attentions of the Countess's
    cavalier&mdash;an author&mdash;are confined to the extraction
    of copy. And anyhow <i>Mary's</i> instincts are sound. Now and
    again she remembers to pity the loneliness of her husband,
    whose cottage light she can see from the window of her bower;
    and once, by a ruse, she gets him to break the conditions and
    visit her; but when he learns that the invitation came from
    her, and not, as alleged, from the Countess, his conscience
    will not permit him to take advantage of his chance. So you
    have the unusual spectacle of a true and loving wife pleading
    in vain for the embraces of her true and loving husband.</p>

    <p>But if her virtue, in the technical sense, remained intact,
    the Serpent had overfed her with <i>pommes de luxe</i>. On her
    return home&mdash;where the restoration of her child might have
    helped matters, but it doesn't know who she is and refuses to
    part from its foster-mother&mdash;we find her lethargic, off
    her feed, indifferent to the claims of menial toil, and
    clamorous (as I have shown) for her rights of the daily
    bath.</p>

    <p>In the first joy of conjugal reunion <i>Ezra</i> consents to
    tolerate the discomfort of this change, but in the end he loses
    patience and hits her. She leaves for London the same
    afternoon.</p>

    <p>Six black months pass over the husband's bowed head, and
    then, on a very windy night (the wind was well done), she makes
    a re-entry, and confesses that, under stress of need, she has
    lapsed from virtue. This is bad news for <i>Ezra</i>, but he is
    prepared to forgive a fault in which he himself has had a fair
    share. Only there must be a sacrifice of something, if moral
    justice is to be appeased. So he chooses between his wife and
    his chapel and does execution on the latter. He goes out into
    the storm and sets the thing alight. His conscience is thus
    purified by fire, the gale being favourable to arson.</p>

    <p>It is a pity that so excellent an object as a brick chapel
    should be the evil genius of the play. Yet so it is. Built of
    the materials of Scandinavian drama, it is always just round
    the corner, heavy with doom. We never see it, but we hear more
    than enough about it, and in the end it becomes a bore which we
    are well rid of.</p>

    <p>The theme of the perils of foster-motherhood is not new, but
    Mrs. MERRICK has treated it freshly and with a very decent
    avoidance of its strictly sexual aspects. But her methods are
    too sedentary. She kept on with her atmosphere long after we
    knew the details of the cottage interior by heart; while a
    whole volume of active tragedy&mdash;<i>Mary's</i> six months
    in London&mdash;was left to our fevered imagination. And the
    sense of reality which she was at such pains to create was
    spoiled by dialogue freely carried on in the immediate vicinity
    of persons who were not supposed to overhear it.</p>

    <p>The chief attraction of <i>Mary-Girl</i> (a silly title) was
    the engaging personality of Miss MAY BLAYNEY. Always a
    fascinating figure to watch, she showed an extraordinary
    sensitiveness of voice and expression. As for that honest and
    admirable actor, Mr. MCKINNEL, who made the perfect foil to her
    charms that every good husband should wish to be, he seems
    never to tire of playing these stern, dour, semi-brutal parts.
    That more genial characters are open to him his success in
    <i>Great Catherine</i> showed. Miss MARY BROUGH, as a
    charwoman, supplied a rare need with her richly-flavoured
    humour and its clipped sentences. All the rest did themselves
    justice. Miss HELEN FERRERS was a shade more aristocratic than
    the aristocrat of stage tradition; and it was not the fault of
    Miss DOROTHY FANE (as her daughter, <i>Lady Folkington</i>)
    that she was required to behave incredibly in the presence of
    her inferiors. I have not much to say for the manners of
    Society in its own circles; but it is probably at its best in
    its intercourse with humbler neighbours. Mrs. MERRICK's picture
    of the <i>Countess</i> on a visit to the <i>Sheppards'</i>
    cottage might have been designed for a poster of the Land
    Campaign.</p>

    <p>There was no dissenting note, I am glad to say, in the
    reception of Mrs. MERRICK's charming self when she appeared
    after the fall of the curtain.</p>

    <p>"A pretty authoress!" said an actress in the stalls.</p>

    <p>"Is that your comment on the play?" I asked.</p>

    <p>"Yes!" she said.</p>

    <h2>A BYGONE.</h2>

    <p>When I see the white-haired and venerable Thompson standing
    behind my equally white-haired but much less venerable father
    at dinner, exuding an atmosphere of worth and uprightness and
    checking by his mere silent presence the more flippant
    tendencies of our conversation; when I hear him whisper into my
    youthful son's ear, "Sherry, Sir?" in the voice of a tolerant
    teetotaler who would not force his principles upon any man but
    hopes sincerely that this one will say No; and when I am
    informed that he promised our bootboy a rapid and inevitable
    descent to a state of infamy and destitution upon discovering
    no more than the fag end of a cigarette behind his ear, then I
    am tempted to recall an incident of fifteen years back, lest it
    be forgotten that Thompson is a man like ourselves who has
    known, and even owned, a human weakness.</p>

    <p>Dinner had begun on that eventful evening at 7.30 P.M., and
    it was drawing within sight of a conclusion, that is, the sweet
    had been eaten and the savoury was overdue, at 9.45 P.M. Four
    of us had trailed thus far through this critical meal: my
    father, a usually patient widower who was becoming more than
    restless; the Robinsons, never a jocund brace of guests, who
    were by now positively sullen, and myself who, being but a
    boy&mdash;of twenty odd years and having little enough to say
    to a woman of fifty-five and her still more antique husband,
    had long ago settled down to a determined silence. Meanwhile
    Thompson, then in his first year of service with us, tarried
    mysteriously heaven knows where.</p>

    <p>The intervals of preparation before each course had been
    growing longer and longer and the pause before the savoury
    threatened to be infinite. My father commanded me to ring the
    bell severely. Longing to escape from the table I did so with
    emphasis, and my ring summoned (to our surprise, for we were
    not aware of her existence in the house) a slightly soiled
    kitchen-maid.</p>

    <p>"Where is Thompson?" asked my father sternly.</p>

    <p>"At the telephone, Sir," stammered the maid.</p>

    <p>"The telephone!" cried my father. "Whatever is the
    matter?"</p>

    <p>The maid started to mumble an explanation, burst into tears
    and fled in alarm, never again to emerge from the back regions.
    My father commanded me to the bell again, but as I rose
    Thompson entered. He was even then a stately and dignified
    person, and it was with a measured tread and slow that he
    advanced upon my father.</p>

    <p>"Will you please serve the savoury at once?" said my
    father.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid it cannot be done, Sir," said Thompson. "May I
    explain, Sir?"</p>

    <p>"What is the meaning of this?" asked my father, fearing some
    terrible disaster below stairs, and sacrificing politeness to
    his guests with the hope of saving lives in the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Thompson cleared his throat.&mdash;"For some weeks, Sir," he
    said, "I have been much worried with financial affairs. Like a
    fool I have invested all my savings in speculative shares, and
    the variations of the market have unduly depressed me. When I
    am depressed I take no food, and that depresses me even
    more."</p>

    <p>You will be as surprised as we were that this was allowed to
    continue, but when a man of so few words as Thompson chooses to
    come out of his shell he is always master of the situation.
    "And so, Sir," he continued, "I have taken the liberty of
    telephoning to the mews for a cab."</p>

    <p>He paused and bowed, as if this made it all clear, and was
    about to withdraw. "Kindly finish serving dinner at once, and
    don't be impudent," my father got out at last.</p>

    <p>Thompson sighed. "It is absolutely out of the question,
    Sir," said he. "Quite, quite impossible."</p>

    <p>"Why on earth?" cried my father.</p>

    <p>Thompson became, if possible, more solemn and deliberate
    than before. "I am drunk, Sir," said he.</p>

    <p>At this point Mrs. Robinson, whose indignation had slowly
    been swelling within her, rose and left the room. Robinson, as
    in duty bound, followed. Neither of them, to my infinite joy,
    has ever returned...</p>

    <p>"Depressed by want of food, Sir," continued Thompson, by
    sheer duress preventing my father from following his guests and
    attempting to pacify them, "I have taken to spirits. I do not
    like the taste of spirits and they go at once to my head. They
    depress me further, Sir, but they intoxicate me. Yes, I am
    undoubtedly tipsy."</p>

    <p>My father seized the opportunity of his pause for reflection
    to order him to leave the room and present himself in the
    morning when he was sober.</p>

    <p>"You dismiss us without notice, Sir," he stated, referring
    to himself and his wife in the kitchen. "First thing in the
    morning we go. And so I have ordered the cab to take us."</p>

    <p>This was a very proper fate for Thompson but came a little
    hard on my father. "But what am <i>I</i> to do?" asked he.</p>

    <p>Thompson regarded him with a desultory smile. "The Mews
    desires to know, Sir," said he, "who will pay for the cab?"</p>

    <p>I ought to be able to state that there followed with the
    cold light of day an apology, with passionate tears and
    remorse, from Thompson, or at least a severe reprimand from my
    father before he consented to keep him on. I regret to say that
    my father, next morning, postponed the interview till the
    evening, and from the evening till the next morning,
    and&mdash;that interview is still pending. If this seems weak,
    you have only to see Thompson to realize that no man with any
    sense of the incongruous could even mention the word "Drink" in
    his presence.</p>

    <p>As for the cab which Thompson had ordered, though we never
    saw it we later heard all about it. It went to the wrong house
    because, as the proprietor of the mews informed us with shame
    and regret, the driver entrusted with the order had been very
    much under the influence of alcohol. Altogether it is a sordid
    tale, made no better by the fact that the house which the
    drunken driver chose to go to and insult was the
    Robinsons'...</p>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>There is at least one thing that will surprise you about
    <i>It Happened in Egypt</i> (METHUEN), and that is that,
    although C.N. and A.M. WILLIAMSON are the writers, motor-cars
    are hardly so much as mentioned throughout. It is a tale of the
    Nile and the Desert, of camels and caravans, told with a quite
    extraordinary power of making you feel that you have visited
    the scenes described. But this, of course, if you have any
    previous experience of the WILLIAMSON method, will not surprise
    you at all. As for the story that strings the scenes together,
    though it promised well, with almost every possible element of
    fictional excitement&mdash;buried treasure, and spies, and
    abductions, and secrets&mdash;somehow the result was not wholly
    up to the expectation thus created. To borrow an appropriate
    simile, the great thrill remained something of a mirage, always
    in sight and never actually reached. Also I wish to record my
    passionate protest against stories of treasure-trove in which
    the treasure is not taken away in sacks and used to enrich the
    hunters; I am all against leaving it underground, for whatever
    charming and romantic reasons. No, it is not so much as a novel
    of adventure that might have happened pretty well anywhere that
    I advise you to read this book, but as a super-guide to scenes
    and sensations that happen in Egypt and nowhere else. From the
    moment when, as one of the WILLIAMSON party, you sit down to
    breakfast on the terrace of Shepherd's, till you take leave of
    your fellow-travellers in the mountain-tomb of QUEEN CANDACE,
    you will enjoy the nearest possible approach to a luxurious
    Egyptian tour, under delightful guidance, and at an inclusive
    fare of six shillings.</p>

    <p>Mr. SETON GORDON is a bold man. It is one thing to call a
    book <i>The Charm of the Hills</i> (CASSELL) and quite another
    to succeed in conveying that charm through the medium of the
    printed word. Perhaps, however, he was encouraged by the
    success that has already attended these pen-pictures of
    Highland scenes in serial form; certainly he knew also that he
    had another source of strength in a collection of the most
    fascinating photographs of mountain scenery and wild life,
    nearly a hundred of which are reproduced in the present volume.
    So that what Mr. GORDON the writer fails to convey about his
    favourite haunts (which is not much) Mr. GORDON the
    photographer is ready to supply. The papers, which range in
    subject from ptarmigan to cairngorms, are written with an
    engaging simplicity and directness, and show a sympathetic
    knowledge of wild nature such as is the reward only of long
    familiarity. The glorious mountain wind blows through them all,
    so that as you read you feel the heather brushing your knees,
    and see the clouds massing on the peaks of
    Ben-something-or-other. Perhaps Mr. GORDON is at his most
    interesting on the subject of the Golden Eagle. There are many
    striking snapshots of the king of birds in his royal home; and
    some stories of court life in an eyrie that are fresh and
    enthralling. One thing that I was specially glad to learn on so
    good authority is that the Golden Eagle, so far from being
    threatened with extinction, is actually increasing in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> deer forests of the North.
       This is intelligence as welcome as it is nowadays unusual.
       The book, which is published at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net,
       is dedicated "to one who loves the glens and corries of the
       hills"; and all who answer to this description should be
       grateful to the writer for his delightful record.</p>

    <p>Goodness knows that of all London's teeming millions I am
    the possessor of the most easily curdled blood, but my flesh
    declined to creep an inch from the first page to the last of
    <i>Animal Ghosts</i> (RIDER). I think it was Mr. ELLIOTT
    O'DONNELL's way of telling his stories that was responsible for
    my indifference. He is so incorrigibly reticent. His idea of a
    well-told ghost story runs on these lines:&mdash;"In the year
    189&mdash;, in the picturesque village of C&mdash;&mdash;, hard
    by the manufacturing town of L&mdash;&mdash;, there lived a
    wealthy gentleman named T&mdash;&mdash; with his cousin
    F&mdash;&mdash; and two friends M&mdash;&mdash; and
    R&mdash;&mdash;." I simply refuse to take any interest in the
    spectres of initials, still less in the spectres of the
    domestic pets of initials. I am no bigot; by all means deny
    your ghost his prerogative of clanking chains and rattling
    bones; but there are certain points on which I do take a firm
    stand, and this matter of initials is one of them. Not one of
    these stories is convincing. Mr. O'DONNELL taps you on the
    chest and whispers hoarsely, "As I stood there my blood
    congealed, I could scarcely breathe. My scalp bristled;" and
    you, if you are like me, hide a yawn and say, "No, really?"
    There is a breezy carelessness, too, about his methods which
    kills a story. He distinctly states, for instance, that the
    story of the "Headless Cat of No. &mdash;&mdash;, Lower Seedley
    Street, Manchester," was told to him by a Mr. ROBERT DANE. In
    the first half of the narrative this gentleman's brother-in-law
    addresses him as <i>Jack</i>, and later on his wife says to
    him, "Oh, <i>Edward</i>." What a man whose own Christian name
    is so much a matter of opinion has to say about seeing headless
    cats does not seem to me to be evidence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There seems to be an increasing public for the volume of
    reflections. At all events Mr. REGINALD LUCAS, who has already
    two or three successes in this kind to his credit, has been
    encouraged to produce another, to which he has given the
    pleasant title of <i>The Measure of our Thoughts</i>
    (HUMPHREYS). It is, of course, difficult to be critical with a
    book like this; either it pleases the reader or it doesn't, and
    that is about all that can be said. One reason for my belief
    that Mr. LUCAS's <i>Thoughts</i> will please is that he has put
    them into the brain of a definitely conceived and very well
    drawn character. They are told in the form of letters by this
    character to his old tutor. The writer is supposed to be the
    rather unattractive and self-conscious eldest son of a noble
    house, who suffers from the presence of a father and sister who
    think him a fool, and a brother whose charm is a continual and
    painful contrast to his own lack of it. The special skill of
    the letters is their self-revelation, which brings out the
    pathos of the writer's position, while at the same time showing
    quite clearly the defects that explained it. Mr. LUCAS, in
    short, does not commit the error of making his hero merely a
    mute, misunderstood paragon, whom anyone with common
    penetration must have recognised as such. On the contrary, we
    sympathise with him, especially in the big tragedy of his life,
    while quite admitting that to any casual acquaintance he must
    have appeared only a dull and uninteresting egoist. This I call
    clever, because it shows that Mr. LUCAS has created a real
    thinker, rather than striven to give him any unusual profundity
    of thought. An agreeable book.</p>

    <p>In the sixteenth chapter of the First Part of <i>The Rocks
    of Valpr&eacute;</i> (FISHER UNWIN) <i>Trevor Mordaunt</i>
    married <i>Christine Wyndham</i>, and on the last page (which
    is the 511th) of the book, "she opened to him the doors of her
    soul, and drew him within...." Granted that <i>Mordaunt</i>,
    with the eyes of steel, was not exactly an oncoming man and
    that when he married <i>Christine</i> he received, as wedding
    presents, two or three brothers-in-law who sponged hopelessly
    upon him, I still think that Miss ETHEL DELL has given us too
    detailed an account of the domestic differences between
    <i>Mordaunt</i> and his wife. For my own part I became frankly
    tired of the pecuniary crises of the <i>Wyndhams</i> and of
    their incurable inability to tell the truth. Had
    <i>Mordaunt</i> got up and given these feckless brethren a
    sound hiding I should have been relieved, but he preferred to
    make them squirm by using his steely eyes. In the future I
    suggest to Miss DELL that she should leave these strong silent
    men alone. They have had their day and gone out of vogue. The
    best part of this book, and indeed the best work Miss DELL has
    yet done, is her treatment of the romantic friendship between
    <i>Christine</i> and <i>Bertrand de Montville</i>. It is
    handled so touchingly and so surely that I resent with all the
    more peevishness the banality of the steel-eyed one.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
